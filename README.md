# qosf-screening-tasks

I solved task 1 as the screening task of the [qosf mentoring program](https://qosf.org/qc_mentorship/ "qosf mentorship link"). I tried to prove my computational/numerical skills, visualization skills, and quantum computing knowledge in this project. I implemented the SWAP test of the multi-qubit system in product state with [numpy](https://numpy.org/ "numpy official page link") and [scipy.optimize.minimize](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html "scipy documentation link about optimize.minimize") function, then visualized the optimization results with static diagrams on parameter space of each qubit and animation on Bloch sphere with [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/ "matplotlib official page link")and [qiskit.visualization](https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/visualization.html "qiskit official documentation link about qiskit.visualization library"). While implementing the SWAP test, I faced several issues, which made me change the computation strategy. I described my final results and transitions on my codes separately, not to make confusion.
