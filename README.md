# qosf-screening-tasks

I solved a task 1 as the screening task of the [qosf mentoring program][https://qosf.org/qc_mentorship/]. In this project, I tried to prove my computational/numerical skills, visualization skills, and knowledge on quantum computing. I implemented the SWAP test of multi-qubit system in product state with [numpy][https://numpy.org/] and [scipy.optimize.minimize][https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html] function, then visualized the optimization results with static diagram on parameter space of each qubit and animation on Bloch sphere with [matplotlib][https://matplotlib.org/]and [qiskit.visualization][https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/visualization.html].
